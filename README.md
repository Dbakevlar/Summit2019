This is an interactive session that can be done a couple ways!

2.  Create a Linux container with Docker: https://www.petri.com/docker-for-windows-create-a-linux-container-on-windows-10
3.  Start an Azure Cloud Shell account with Azure Cloud storage and play there!https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview

The slides can get you started with the scripts, or even better-  come see me take you through it all and teach you how to wriite scripts interactively!!
